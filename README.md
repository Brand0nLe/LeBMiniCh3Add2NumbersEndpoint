Mini Challenge 3 - Add 2 Numbers Endpoint

This is a web API project that will take the users two inputs in the url and add the two numbers together. The sum will show up for the user when running MiniCh3/Adding/number1/number2 after the localhost URL. For example if it's MiniCh3/Adding/3/5 the outcome would be 8.

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman, you can hit the plus sign at the top of Postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a web browser or Postman, add /MiniCh3/Adding to the end. It should look something like this: https://localhost:7125/MiniCh3/Adding
7. At this point you're almost done! Just add a /number1/number2 (but with your preferred numbers of course) at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7125/MiniCh3/Adding/11/2000
8. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.



# Peer Review: Ulises Ortega
The endpoint works as intended it takes the two numbers and output the addition of the 2 numbers.
